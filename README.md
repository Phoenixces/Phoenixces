### <b>⚡One Quick fact about Programming World: ✨ The first computer “bug” was an actual real-life bug</b> ✨  
In the programming world, a bug is an error that causes a program to crash or behave in strange ways. First coined by Thomas Edison in 1878 (to refer to technical errors of the period), the term “bug” would eventually find mainstream use in modern computing.

However, it was in 1947 that the first case of a computer bug was recorded. Grace Hopper, an admiral in the US Navy, was working on a Mark II computer when she discovered a moth had become stuck in the relay, thus causing it to malfunction.

Once the moth🦋 was removed, she wrote in her journal “first actual case of bug being found” – and the rest is history.......🤯😮
